Since we're dealing with API keys in this example, many of which are often unable to be recovered after being assigned, the unability for the Named Tuple to change data means that you don't have to worry about accidentally changing a key and being unable to recover the original.\n",

Since the dictionary is a built-in method in Python, it is more familiar to most users, and does not require importing and using an additional library. For the Named Tuple, users must be careful to ensure they are using the same version of the collections library when reading from and writing to the pickle file, as pickle will raise concerns if the version of a package is different when reading than it was when writing."
