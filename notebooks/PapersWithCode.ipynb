In this limit the underlying hidden vector (that constructs the rank-one matrix) has a number of non-zero components that scales sub-linearly with the total dimension of the vector, and the signal strength tends to infinity at an appropriate speed. We prove explicit low-dimensional variational formulas for the asymptotic mutual information between the spike and the observed noisy matrix in suitable sparse limits. For Bernoulli and Bernoulli-Rademacher distributed vectors, and when the sparsity and signal strength satisfy an appropriate scaling relation, these formulas imply sharp 0-1 phase transitions for the asymptotic minimum mean-square-error. A similar phase transition was analyzed recently in the context of sparse high-dimensional linear regression (compressive sensing).',\n",

Combining our\\nresults with visible spectra, we find that Trojans and Hildas possess similar\\noverall spectral shapes, suggesting that the two minor body populations share a\\ncommon progenitor population. A more detailed examination reveals that while\\nthe red Trojans and Hildas have nearly identical spectra, less-red Hildas are\\nsystematically bluer in the visible and redder in the near-infrared than\\nless-red Trojans, indicating a putative broad, shallow absorption feature\\nbetween 0.5 and 1.0 $\\\\mu$m. We argue that the less-red and red objects found in\\nboth Hildas and Trojans represent two distinct surface chemistries and\\nattribute the small discrepancy between less-red Hildas and Trojans to the\\ndifference in surface temperatures between the two regions.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Segmentation of moving objects in dynamic scenes is a key process in scene understanding for navigation tasks. Classical cameras suffer from motion blur in such scenarios rendering them effete. On the contrary, event cameras, because of their high temporal resolution and lack of motion blur, are tailor-made for this problem. We present an approach for monocular multi-motion segmentation, which combines bottom-up feature tracking and top-down motion compensation into a unified pipeline, which is the first of its kind to our knowledge. Using the events within a time-interval, our method segments the scene into multiple motions by splitting and merging. We further speed up our method by using the concept of motion propagation and cluster keyslices. The approach was successfully evaluated on both challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios from the EV-IMO, EED, and MOD datasets and outperformed the state-of-the-art detection rate by 12\\\\%, achieving a new state-of-the-art average detection rate of 81.06%, 94.2% and 82.35% on the aforementioned datasets. To enable further research and systematic evaluation of multi-motion segmentation, we present and open-source a new dataset/benchmark called MOD++, which includes challenging sequences and extensive data stratification in-terms of camera and object motion, velocity magnitudes, direction, and rotational speeds.',\n",

This\\npossibility, joined to the completely superconducting nature of our system,\\nprovides temperature modulations with unprecedented amplitude of $\\\\sim$ 100 mK\\nand transfer coefficients exceeding 1 K per flux quantum at 25 mK. Then, this\\nquantum structure represents a fundamental step towards the realization of\\ncaloritronic logic components, such as thermal transistors, switches and memory\\ndevices [10,11]. These elements, combined with heat interferometers [3,4,12]\\nand diodes [13,14], would complete the thermal conversion of the most important\\nphase-coherent electronic devices and benefit cryogenic microcircuits requiring\\nenergy management, such as quantum computing architectures and radiation\\nsensors.',\n",

For an odd occupancy of the dot and\\nintermediate coupling to the reservoir, the Kondo effect can develop in the\\nnormal state and screen the local magnetic moment of the dot. This leads to\\nsinglet-doublet transitions that strongly affect the Josephson effect in a\\nsingle-level quantum dot: the sign of the supercurrent changes from positive to\\nnegative (0 to $\\\\pi$-junction). In the regime of strongest competition between\\nthe Kondo effect and proximity effect, meaning that the Kondo temperature\\nequals the superconducting gap, the magnetic state of the dot undergoes a first\\norder quantum transition induced by the superconducting phase difference across\\nthe junction. This is revealed experimentally by anharmonic current-phase\\nrelations. In addition, the very specific electronic configuration of clean\\ncarbon nanotubes, with two nearly orbitally degenerated states, leads to\\ndifferent physics depending whether only one or both quasi-degenerate upper\\nlevels of the dots participate to transport, which is determined by their\\noccupancy and relative widths.

       "   'abstract': 'One common method for stabilizing robots after a push is the Instantaneous Capture Point, however, this has the fundamental limitation of assuming constant height. Although there are several works for balancing bipedal robots including height variations in 2D, the amount of literature on 3D models is limited. There are optimization methods using variable Center of Pressure (CoP) and reaction force to the ground, although they do not provide the physical region where a robot can step and require a precomputation for the analysis. This work provides the necessary and sufficient conditions to maintain balance of the 3D Variable Height Inverted Pendulum (VHIP) with both, fixed and variable CoP. We also prove that the 3D VHIP with Fixed CoP is the same as its 2D version, and we generalize controllers working on the 2D VHIP to the 3D VHIP. We also show the generalization of the Divergent Component of Motion to the 3D VHIP and we provide an alternative motion decomposition for the analysis of height and CoP strategies independently. This allow us to generalize previous global feedback controllers done in the 2D VHIP to the 3D VHIP with a Variable CoP.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Abstract: Modern electronic and photonic devices rely on single-crystalline thin film semiconductors for high performance and reproducibility. The emerging halide perovskites have extraordinary electronic and photonic properties and can be synthesized via low cost solution-based methods. They have been used in a variety of devices with performance approaching or over the devices based on conventional materials. However, their solution based growth method is intrinsically challenge to grow large scale single-crystalline thin film due to the random nucleation and isotropous growth of the crystal. Here, we report the growth of centimeter-scale perovskite single-crystalline thin films by controlling the nucleation density and growth rate of the crystal under a spatially confined growth condition. The hydrophobic treatment on substrates inhibits nucleation and accelerates the growth of single-crystalline thin film, providing enough space for initial nucleus growing up quickly without touching each other. Single-crystalline perovskite thin-film with an aspect ratio of 1000 (1 cm in side length, 10 μm in thickness) has been successfully grown. The low trap density and the high mobility of the as-grown thin film show a high crystallinity. The photodetector based on the perovskite thin film has achieved a gain\\u2009~\\u200910^4, benefitting from the short transit time of the carries due to the high mobility and thin thickness of the active layer.

It is the first GRB afterglow detected at 250--500 MHz frequency range and the second brightest GRB detected with the uGMRT. Even though the GRB is observed for nearly 1000 days, there is no evidence of transition to non-relativistic regime. We also analyse the archival ${\\\\it Chandra}$ X-ray data on day $\\\\sim 70$ and day $\\\\sim 200$. We also find no evidence of a jet break from the analysis of combined data. We fit synchrotron afterglow emission arising from a relativistic, isotropic, self-similar deceleration as well as from a shock-breakout of wide-angle cocoon. Our data also allow us to discern the nature and the density of the circumburst medium. We find that the density profile deviates from a standard constant density medium and suggests that the GRB exploded in a stratified wind like medium. Our analysis shows that the lowest frequency measurements covering the absorbed part of the light curves are critical to unravel the GRB environment. Our data combined with other published measurements indicate that the radio afterglow has contribution from two components: a weak, possibly slightly off-axis jet and a surrounding wider cocoon, consistent with the results of Izzo et al. (2019). The cocoon emission likely dominates at early epochs, whereas the jet starts to dominate at later epochs, resulting in flatter radio lightcurves.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Negotiations began 1n 1968 for a telescope facility at Perth Observatory for NASA's International Planetary Patrol Network. 1,000 days later the telescope saw first light. The facility bears no resemblance to other observatories. Inside a dome, the telescope sits on a 42 ft tall concrete pier with a wrap-around staircase and concrete legs. Surrounding forest is similar in height to the dome, the design of which is counter intuitive. This study investigated why, at the risk of compromising performance, there was a departure from standard design, and to to identify drivers for the decision making. Observatory visitors learn of a government architect, Tadeusz Andrzejaczek who made whimsical, successive increases to the height of the structure. Though designed in collaboration with Acting Government Astronomer, Bertrand Harris, it is improbable that a public servant architect would have such influence over a scientific installation. Vibration amelioration was met by designing massive strength and rigidity into the structure. Thermal expansion and wind stresses were reduced using features such as shade fins and protective walls, and ground thermal disturbance was addressed by simply making it tall. Seeing measurements were not a significant design consideration. The facility exists with its current floor height because of successive approvals for modification. The initial design was by Harris and requests for redesigns came from him but in close negotiation the Andrzejaczek who desired a structure of futuristic shape and proportions. Harris's designs were influenced by his personal English background and the Old Perth Observatory where he worked as an astronomer. Andrzejaczek's design was influenced by an observatory in his birth city, his alignment with contemporary designers and his artistic flair.\",\n",

It can be computed and trained very efficiently, making it ideal for online use for high speed eye trackers as well as for energy saving pupil detection in mobile eye tracking. The approach is inspired by the BORE and CBF algorithms and generalizes the binary comparison by Haar features. Since these features are intrinsically very susceptible to noise and fluctuating light conditions, we combine them with conditional pupil shape probabilities. In addition, we also rank each feature according to its importance in determining the pupil shape. Another advantage of our method is the use of statistical learning, which is very efficient and can even be used online. https://atreus.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/seafile/d/8e2ab8c3fdd444e1a135/?p=%2FStatsPupil&mode=list',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'We are experiencing a period of extreme intellectual effervescence in the\\narea of cosmology. A huge volume of observational data in unprecedented\\nquantity and quality and a more consistent theoretical framework propelled\\ncosmology to an era of precision, turning the discipline into a cutting-edge\\narea of contemporary science. Observations with type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia),\\nshowed that the expanding Universe is accelerating, an unexplained fact in the\\ntraditional decelerated model. Identifying the cause of this acceleration is\\nthe most fundamental problem in the area. As in the scientific renaissance, the\\nsolution will guide the course of the discipline in the near future and the\\npossible answers (whether dark energy, some extension of general relativity or\\na still unknown mechanism) should also leverage the development of physics. In\\nthis context, without giving up a pedagogical approach, we present an overview\\nof both the main theoretical results and the most significant observational\\ndiscoveries of cosmology in the last 100 years. The saga of cosmology will be\\npresented in a trilogy. In this article (Part I), based on the articles by\\nEinstein, de Sitter, Friedmann, Lema\\\\^itre and Hubble, we will describe the\\nperiod between the origins of cosmology and the discovery of Universal\\nexpansion (1929). In Part II, we will see the period from 1930 to 1997, closing\\nwith the old standard decelerated model. The Part III will be entirely devoted\\nto the accelerated model of the universe, the cosmic paradigm of the XXI\\ncentury.',\n",

In this paper, we present a decomposition-based approach to addressing this problem. We introduce world-set decompositions (WSDs), a space-efficient formalism for representing any finite set of possible worlds over relational databases. WSDs are therefore a strong representation system for any relational query language. We study the problem of efficiently evaluating relational algebra queries on sets of worlds represented by WSDs.

Here we present new photometric properties of 45 Jovian trojans from the K2 mission of the Kepler space telescope, and present phase-folded light curves for 44 targets, including (11351) Leucus, one of the targets of the Lucy mission. We extend our sample to 101 asteroids with previous K2 Trojan measurements, then compare their combined amplitude- and frequency distributions to other ground-based and space data. We show that there is a dichotomy in the periods of Trojans with a separation at $\\\\sim 100$ hr. We find that 25% of the sample are slow rotators (P$\\\\geq$30 hr), which excess can be attributed to binary objects. We also show that 32 systems can be classified as potential detached binary systems. Finally, we calculate density and rotation constraints for the asteroids. Both the spin barrier and fits to strengthless ellipsoid models indicate low densities and thus compositions similar to cometary and TNO populations throughout the sample. This supports the scenario of outer Solar System origin for Jovian trojans.',\n",

We present the 10.4m GTC observations of the afterglow of GRB 190829A and underlying supernova and compare it against a similar GRB 180728A and discuss the implications on underlying physical mechanisms producing these two GRBs. Methods. We present multi-band photometric data along with spectroscopic follow-up observations taken with the 10.4m GTC telescope. Together with the data from the prompt emission, the 10.4m GTC data are used to understand the emission mechanisms and possible progenitor. Results. A detailed analysis of multi-band data of the afterglow demands cooling frequency to pass between the optical and X-ray bands at early epochs and dominant with underlying SN 2019oyw later on. Conclusions. Prompt emission temporal properties of GRB 190829A and GRB 180728A are similar, however the two pulses seem different in the spectral domain. We found that the supernova (SN) 2019oyw associated with GRB 190829A, powered by Ni decay, is of Type Ic-BL and that the spectroscopic/photometric properties of this SN is consistent with those observed for SN 1998bw but evolved comparatively early.',\n",

       "   'abstract': \"High resolution images are widely used in our daily life, whereas high-speed video capture is challenging due to the low frame rate of cameras working at the high resolution mode. Digging deeper, the main bottleneck lies in the low throughput of existing imaging systems. Towards this end, snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) was proposed as a promising solution to improve the throughput of imaging systems by compressive sampling and computational reconstruction. During acquisition, multiple high-speed images are encoded and collapsed to a single measurement. After this, algorithms are employed to retrieve the video frames from the coded snapshot. Recently developed Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms make it possible for SCI reconstruction in large-scale problems. However, the lack of high-resolution encoding systems still precludes SCI's wide application. In this paper, we build a novel hybrid coded aperture snapshot compressive imaging (HCA-SCI) system by incorporating a dynamic liquid crystal on silicon and a high-resolution lithography mask. We further implement a PnP reconstruction algorithm with cascaded denoisers for high quality reconstruction. Based on the proposed HCA-SCI system and algorithm, we achieve a 10-mega pixel SCI system to capture high-speed scenes, leading to a high throughput of 4.6G voxels per second. Both simulation and real data experiments verify the feasibility and performance of our proposed HCA-SCI scheme.\",\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Sentiment analysis has become a very important tool for analysis of social\\nmedia data. There are several methods developed for this research field, many\\nof them working very differently from each other, covering distinct aspects of\\nthe problem and disparate strategies. Despite the large number of existent\\ntechniques, there is no single one which fits well in all cases or for all data\\nsources. Supervised approaches may be able to adapt to specific situations but\\nthey require manually labeled training, which is very cumbersome and expensive\\nto acquire, mainly for a new application. In this context, in here, we propose\\nto combine several very popular and effective state-of-the-practice sentiment\\nanalysis methods, by means of an unsupervised bootstrapped strategy for\\npolarity classification. One of our main goals is to reduce the large\\nvariability (lack of stability) of the unsupervised methods across different\\ndomains (datasets). Our solution was thoroughly tested considering thirteen\\ndifferent datasets in several domains such as opinions, comments, and social\\nmedia. The experimental results demonstrate that our combined method (aka,\\n10SENT) improves the effectiveness of the classification task, but more\\nimportantly, it solves a key problem in the field. It is consistently among the\\nbest methods in many data types, meaning that it can produce the best (or close\\nto best) results in almost all considered contexts, without any additional\\ncosts (e.g., manual labeling). Our self-learning approach is also very\\nindependent of the base methods, which means that it is highly extensible to\\nincorporate any new additional method that can be envisioned in the future.\\nFinally, we also investigate a transfer learning approach for sentiment\\nanalysis as a means to gather additional (unsupervised) information for the\\nproposed approach and we show the potential of this technique to improve our\\nresults.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The flaring M4 dwarf GJ 1243 has become a benchmark for studying stellar\\nflare and starspot activity thanks to the exceptional photometric monitoring\\narchive from the Kepler mission. New light curves from the TESS mission for\\nthis star allow precise stellar activity characterization over more than a\\ndecade timescale. We have carried out the first flare and starspot analysis of\\nGJ 1243 from over 50 days of data from TESS Sectors 14 and 15. Using 133 flare\\nevents detected in the 2-minute cadence TESS data, we compare the cumulative\\nflare frequency distributions, and find the flare activity for GJ 1243 is\\nunchanged between the Kepler and TESS epochs. Two distinct starspot groups are\\nfound in the TESS data, with the primary spot having the same rotational period\\nand phase as seen in Kepler. The phase of the secondary spot feature is\\nconsistent with the predicted location of the secondary starspot and\\nmeasurement of weak differential rotation, suggesting this secondary spot may\\nbe long-lived and stable in both latitude and longitude. As expected for this\\nhighly active star, the constant spot and flare activity reveal no sign of\\nsolar-like activity cycles over 10 years. However, we highlight the unique\\nability for Kepler and TESS to use flare rates to detect activity cycles.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Broadband dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) based on portable mode-locked fiber\\nfrequency combs is a powerful tool for in situ, calibration free, multi-species\\nspectroscopy. While the acquisition of a single spectrum with mode-locked DCS\\ntypically takes microseconds to milliseconds, the applications of these\\nspectrometers have generally been limited to systems and processes with time\\nchanges on the order of seconds or minutes due to the need to average many\\nspectra to reach a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here, we demonstrate\\nhigh-speed, continuous, fiber mode-locked laser DCS with down to 11 $\\\\mu$s time\\nresolution. We achieve this by filtering the comb spectra using portable\\nFabry-Perot cavities to generate filtered combs with 1 GHz tooth spacing. The 1\\nGHz spacing increases the DCS acquisition speed and SNR for a given optical\\nbandwidth while retaining a sufficient spacing to resolve absorption features\\nover a wide range of conditions. We measure spectra of methane inside a rapid\\ncompression machine throughout the 16 ms compression cycle with 133 cm$^{-1}$\\nbandwidth (4000 comb teeth) and 1.4 ms time resolution by spectrally filtering\\none of the combs. By filtering both combs, we measured a single-shot, 25\\ncm$^{-1}$ (750 comb teeth) spectrum of CO around 6330 cm$^{-1}$ in 11 $\\\\mu$s.\\nThe technique enables simultaneously high-speed and high-resolution DCS\\nmeasurements, and can be applied anywhere within the octave-spanning spectrum\\nof robust and portable fiber mode-locked frequency combs.',\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), inspired by biological visual cortex systems, are a powerful category of artificial neural networks that can extract the hierarchical features of raw data to greatly reduce the network parametric complexity and enhance the predicting accuracy. They are of significant interest for machine learning tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, playing board games and medical diagnosis. Optical neural networks offer the promise of dramatically accelerating computing speed to overcome the inherent bandwidth bottleneck of electronics. Here, we demonstrate a universal optical vector convolutional accelerator operating beyond 10 TeraFLOPS (floating point operations per second), generating convolutions of images of 250,000 pixels with 8 bit resolution for 10 kernels simultaneously, enough for facial image recognition. We then use the same hardware to sequentially form a deep optical CNN with ten output neurons, achieving successful recognition of full 10 digits with 900 pixel handwritten digit images with 88% accuracy. Our results are based on simultaneously interleaving temporal, wavelength and spatial dimensions enabled by an integrated microcomb source.

Multidimensional simulations have shown that\\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities provide self-enrichment of the accreted envelope\\nwith material from the outermost layers of the white dwarf, at levels that\\nagree with observations.

The early stages of the explosion (i.e.,\\nmass-accretion and initiation of the runaway) have been computed with the 1-D\\nhydrodynamic code SHIVA. When convection extends throughout the entire\\nenvelope, the structures for each model were mapped into 3-D Cartesian grids\\nand were subsequently followed with the multidimensional code FLASH. Two key\\nphysical quantities were extracted from the 3-D simulations and subsequently\\nimplemented into SHIVA, which was used to complete the simulation through the\\nlate expansion and ejection stages: the time-dependent amount of mass\\ndredged-up from the outer white dwarf layers, and the time-dependent convective\\nvelocity profile throughout the envelope. More massive envelopes than those\\nreported from previous models with pre-enrichment have been found.
